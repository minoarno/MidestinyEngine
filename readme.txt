Midestiny Engine

Was created for a school project on how to make and use a game engine.

The Midestiny Engine contains functionality such as:
- Entity Component System inspired by Unity
- Scenemanager that handles scenes inspired by Overlord
- SDL_mixer Audio service locator
- Command pattern used in both inputsystem and button system
- Logging using spdlog, inspired by The Cherno
- Text, Texture2D and SpriteSheets
- Observer pattern to keep track of lives
- METime to make elapsed seconds global. Also has the option of time manipulation.
- Possibility of using a binary reader and writer (unused)

Built in Visual Studio 2019 using C++17.


In the Sandbox I attempted to recreate a version of QBert.
